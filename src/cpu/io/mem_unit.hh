/**
 * This models a pipelined memory unit consisting of three stages
 *    - Address calculation   (S0)
 *    - Address translation   (S1)
 *    - Memory request issue  (S2)
 *
 * s0_inst -> [ S0 ] -> s1_inst -> [ S1 ] -> s2_inst -> [ S2 ]
 *
 * Since this unit is designed for a simple processor pipeline (i.e., in-order
 * CPU), it should be kept simple.
 *
 *  - Instructions in load and store queue are drained in the order they're
 *    inserted into the queues. This models FIFO queues or circular buffers in
 *    HW to avoid expensive associative lookups.
 *
 *  - Loads and stores are issued in order. There can be multiple loads and
 *    stores in flight at the same time (i.e., depending on the size of load
 *    and store queues)
 *
 *  - A load following a store to the same address must be stalled until the
 *    store is executed (i.e., being issued to memory). This avoid adding logic
 *    to passing value between the two instructions.
