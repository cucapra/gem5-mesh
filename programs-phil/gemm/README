Usage: ./build.sh <x86/riscv> <opt/debug>

Builds all of the matrix multiply implementations


RISCV meant to run on gem5 commit 53e74695ac28e02d10594af0ef6afff6536a0d35 (may 4 2019)
Also doesn't seem to work with ruby (instead use --caches --l2cache in config/se.py)
This looks like what BRG does in there release http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/pdfs/ta-gem5-riscv-slides-carrv2018.pdf
